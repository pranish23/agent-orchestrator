Agentic Google Workspace Orchestrator – Technical Assignment
===========================================================

### Overview

Build an intelligent orchestrator that executes natural language queries across Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Drive. The system must classify intent, route to appropriate services, execute operations in parallel, and synthesize coherent responses.

**Time:** 6–8 hours  
**Stack:** Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL (pgvector), Redis, OpenAI/Anthropic

***

### Problem Statement

Users want to interact with their Google Workspace using natural language:

> "Cancel my Turkish Airlines flight"  
> → Search Gmail for booking → Find calendar event → Draft cancellation email

> "Prepare for tomorrow's client meeting with Acme Corp"  
> → Find calendar event → Search emails with client → Pull Drive documents

> "What's on my calendar next week where john@company.com is invited?"  
> → Search calendar → Filter by attendee → Return formatted list

**Your job:** Build the orchestration layer that makes this work.

### System Architecture

User Query  
↓  
Intent Classifier (LLM)  
↓  
Query Planner (Creates execution DAG)  
↓  
Service Orchestrator (Parallel execution)  
- Gmail Agent (search, read, send, draft)  
- GCal Agent (search, create, update, delete)  
- Drive Agent (search, read, share)  
↓  
Embedding & Search Layer (Vector DB + semantic search)  
↓  
Response Synthesizer (Natural language output)

***

### Core Components

#### 1. Intent Classifier

Parse queries into structured intents, e.g.:

```json
{
  "services": ["gmail", "gcal"],
  "intent": "cancel_flight",
  "entities": { "airline": "Turkish Airlines" },
  "steps": [
    "search_gmail_for_booking",
    "find_calendar_event",
    "draft_cancellation_email"
  ]
}
```

#### 2. Query Planner

Convert intent into execution plan with dependencies:

- Parallel operations: Search Gmail + Calendar simultaneously  
- Sequential dependencies: Extract booking reference → Draft email  
- Fallback strategies for missing data

#### 3. Service Agents

Each agent (Gmail/GCal/Drive) implements:

- `search()`: Semantic search using embeddings  
- `execute()`: Perform write operations (send, create, delete)  
- `get_context()`: Retrieve full content for LLM reasoning  

Gmail capabilities:

- `search_emails`, `get_email`, `send_email`, `draft_email`, `update_labels`

GCal capabilities:

- `search_events`, `get_event`, `create_event`, `update_event`, `delete_event`

Drive capabilities:

- `search_files`, `get_file`, `share_file`, `create_folder`, `move_file`

#### 4. Embedding & Search

- Generate embeddings for:
  - Emails (subject + body)
  - Events (title + description)
  - Files (name + content)
- Store in pgvector with cosine similarity index  
- Hybrid search: Vector similarity + keyword filtering (date, sender, etc.)  
- Target: \<500ms query latency, Precision@5 \> 0.8

#### 5. Response Synthesizer

Aggregate results from multiple agents and generate natural language, e.g.:

> "I found your Turkish Airlines booking (TK1234) in an email from Oct 15.  
> ✓ Calendar event 'Istanbul → NYC Flight' on Nov 5 at 10:30 AM  
> ✓ Drafted cancellation email to support@turkishairlines.com  
> Would you like me to send it?"

***

### Sample Queries (Test These)

**Single Service:**

- "What's on my calendar next week?"  
- "Find emails from sarah@company.com about the budget"  
- "Show me PDFs in Drive from last month"

**Multi-Service:**

- "Cancel my Turkish Airlines flight" (Gmail + GCal)  
- "Prepare for tomorrow's meeting with Acme Corp" (GCal + Gmail + Drive)  
- "Find events next week that conflict with my out-of-office doc" (GCal + Drive)

**Hard Cases:**

- "Move the meeting with John" (ambiguous: which John? which meeting?)  
- "That email about the proposal" (requires conversation context)  
- "Next Tuesday" (temporal reasoning + timezone handling)

***

### Scaling to 1M Users

#### Architecture

Load Balancer  
↓  
API Servers (FastAPI) × N  
↓  
Redis (cache) + PostgreSQL (metadata + pgvector)  
↓  
Task Queue (Celery workers)  
↓  
Google APIs + LLM APIs

#### Key Strategies

- **Caching:** Redis for embeddings (1 hr TTL), intent classifications, conversation context  
- **Rate Limiting:** 100 queries/user/hour, respect Google API quotas (250 units/sec)  
- **Async Processing:** Celery for long-running orchestrations (2–5s queries)  
- **Pre-computation:** Background sync every 15 mins, index new emails/events/files  
- **Sharding:** Partition by `user_id` for metadata and embeddings  
- **Multi-region:** Deploy in US/EU/APAC, route to nearest region

#### Metrics to Monitor

- P99 latency: \<2s  
- Cache hit rate: \>80%  
- Google API errors: \<0.1%  
- Embedding freshness: \<15min lag

### Database Schema (Simplified)

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255),
    google_access_token TEXT,
    google_refresh_token TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE conversations (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    query TEXT,
    intent JSONB,
    response TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE gmail_cache (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID,
    email_id VARCHAR(255),
    subject TEXT,
    body_preview TEXT,
    embedding vector(1536),
    received_at TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(user_id, email_id)
);

-- Similar tables for gcal_cache, gdrive_cache

CREATE INDEX ON gmail_cache USING ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops);
```

***

### API Endpoints

**POST `/api/v1/query`**

Request:

```json
{
  "query": "Cancel my Turkish Airlines flight",
  "conversation_id": "uuid"
}
```

Response: Natural language + `actions_taken`

**GET `/api/v1/auth/google`**  
→ OAuth flow

**POST `/api/v1/sync/trigger`**  
→ Manually sync Gmail/GCal/Drive

**GET `/api/v1/sync/status`**  
→ Last sync timestamps per service

***

### What Makes This Hard

- **Intent Ambiguity:**  
  "Move the meeting with John" → Which John? Which meeting? When?  
- **Cross-Service Dependencies:**  
  Failures must be handled gracefully (Gmail succeeds, Calendar fails)  
- **Temporal Reasoning:**  
  "Next week" depends on timezone, work week vs calendar week, context  
- **Embedding Quality:**  
  What to embed? How to chunk email threads? Temporal decay?  
- **Rate Limits:**  
  Google APIs have strict quotas—need intelligent batching and caching  
- **Security:**  
  Multi-tenant isolation, OAuth token refresh, audit logging

### Hints

- Start with single-service queries before multi-service  
- Prompt engineering for intent classification is critical  
- Metadata filtering \> pure vector search for speed  
- Google APIs fail often—implement retry with backoff  
- Store last 5 queries for conversation context ("that email")
